Complicated objects are not redisgned from scratch. They re-iterate existing objects.

An exisiting design is a prototype.

A prototype is a fully or partially initialized object that you clone and then subsequently utilize the cloned object.

We make copy of the prototype and customize it. Requires a deep copy.

To make cloning convenient we make a factory.
